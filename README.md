Ultratabs is a webproxy based on Ultraviolet that allows you to browse the web in a unrestricted virtual browsers. This gives you full access to the internet, regardless of restrictive firewalls, browsers, or any other censorship. This functions similarly to a VPN but at the browser level. Many other webproxies exist, but none have the seamless UI and expirience as this (mostly due to being based on Arc). This project is perfect for Arc users, or if you just love the UI of Arc and want to free your internet expirience.
