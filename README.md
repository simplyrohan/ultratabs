> [!IMPORTANT]  
> This site will not function until you provide it a Wisp server. Modify this at `/scripts/proxy.mjs`. I'm working on a better way to specify the server

# Commands
To build the CSS, run 
```
sass styles/sass/:styles/css
```

# Notes
Yes, I know that its terrible to put the built JS files for UV, BareMux, Epoxy, etc. It makes it easier for testing, but I will do it better soon.

# Bugs
- [ ] Spotify login doesn't work (fix: switch to scramjet + unstable libcurl)
